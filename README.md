<h1>Hotelplanner.com Sales and Managment system (Work In Progress)</h1>

<p><b>About this app</b>: This app is a companion app for hotelplanner.com independent hotel planners.</p>


<p><b>Backstory</b>: I was one of their commission-based hotel planners, and realized that their system is not very organizationally friendly. I wanted to make an app that did what I need to manage my calls, commissions, and QA tracking.</p>
</p> Since then, I was kicked off the platform for not making sales, and have published this app here for my portfolio.</p>
